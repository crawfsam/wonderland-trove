# wonderland-trove

This project is meant to eventually turn into an e-commerce site for my cousin's business. 
She creates [pyrography art from wood and foraged bones](https://www.instagram.com/wonderland_trove), and would like to move away from Etsy.
Background story: Etsy has been increasing its fees significantly, affecting the ability for small business owners like her to make a viable profit.
I would like to create a site that she can update the products herself, with a non-technical background (potentially by using Airtable together with their API),
and to integrate a payment solution that will not take too much of her profit.
